        This platform was built by a student, for students. As a current SJSU student, I’ve experienced firsthand how confusing and time-consuming it can be to choose the right classes, track GE requirements, and figure out which professors are worth your time. That’s why I created this tool — to help students pick classes smarter, manage their credits clearly, and access professor ratings all in one place. It’s fast, efficient, and designed to save you stress every semester.
